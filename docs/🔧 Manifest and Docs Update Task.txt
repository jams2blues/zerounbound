🔧 Manifest and Docs Update Task (for AI Assistant)

Context: You are working in the jams2blues/zerounbound repository. This repo follows a strict append‑only manifest and invariants system. All new changes must be fully integrated into docs/Master_Overview_And_Manifest_zerounbound_contractmanagement.md (the “manifest”), and any addendums or patch notes must be consolidated into that file. After consolidation, the only markdown files under zerounbound/docs/ should be:
AI_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md
Master_Overview_And_Manifest_zerounbound_contractmanagement.md
TZIP_Compliance_Invariants_ZeroContract_V4.md
🔧 Manifest and Docs Update Task.txt

What to do:
Reload all docs and invariants: At the start of your session, re‑open and re‑read the current Master_Overview_And_Manifest_zerounbound_contractmanagement.md, AI_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md and TZIP_Compliance_Invariants_ZeroContract_V4.md to ensure you are working from the latest version and fully understand all existing rules and structure.
Consolidate and compress:
Move the content of any new addendums, patch notes or feature docs into the manifest.
Do not simply append these files verbatim; instead, merge their information into the appropriate sections (e.g. new “Addendum rXXXX” section, updated invariants, new entries in the source‑tree map and change log).
Compress repetitive or obvious material, but never omit important details – the manifest must remain exhaustive enough that a new AI could rebuild the entire repo from scratch without extra research.
Once merged, delete the separate addendum file so that only the three docs listed above remain in docs/.
Update manifest fields:
Revision header: Increment the revision id (rXXXX) and update the UTC date to today’s date. Write a concise summary of what changed.
Change Log: Append a new entry summarizing the changes for this revision.
Progress Ledger: Create or update the ledger entry for the new revision with bullet points describing what was done (files touched, features added or fixed, new invariants, removed files, etc.).
Source‑Tree Map: Add or remove lines for any new or deleted files. Keep the list alphabetical, preserve case, and follow the “path — description; Imports; Exports” format.
Invariants: Append new invariant numbers for any implicit rules introduced by your changes. Do not reuse existing numbers; always start from the next available integer. Each invariant must clearly state its scope tags ([F], [C], [E], [I]), and a short but explicit description of the rule.
Reserved, Appendices and Bundle index: If your changes affect these sections, update them accordingly.
Section integrity: Preserve every existing section verbatim unless factual corrections are needed. Never delete or reorder existing history or invariants.
Follow project protocols:
Comply with all invariants, design patterns, TZIP compliance rules and AI collaboration instructions (as defined in AI_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md and TZIP_Compliance_Invariants_ZeroContract_V4.md).
Maintain the retro 8‑bit theme and responsive design constraints.
If you modify any code, ensure there are no missing imports, unused variables, dead constants or stylistic violations. Run linting or formatting if necessary.
Perform a meticulous oversight pass:
Proof‑read every modified line.
Verify that all references to files and paths are correct and case‑sensitive.
Check that no important content was accidentally dropped during consolidation.
Ensure that the invariants list, changelog and progress ledger accurately reflect the work done.
Return a production‑ready manifest:
Emit the fully updated Master_Overview_And_Manifest_zerounbound_contractmanagement.md without placeholders or stubs. The file has no length cap – it may grow as needed.
Do not summarize the manifest or truncate sections; deliver the complete content in your output.
Confirm that only the three allowed markdown files remain in the docs/ folder.
By following this task prompt after each revision session, you will keep our single‑source‑of‑truth manifest accurate, comprehensive and easy for future AI agents to understand.
